# ðŸ§© JAX DQN on Jumanji's Game2048-v1

This repository showcases a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** implementation built with **JAX**, trained on the [`Game2048-v1`](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji/tree/main/jumanji/environments/logic/game_2048) environment from the **Jumanji** suite.

The project demonstrates how to train reinforcement learning agents efficiently in a **fully JIT-compiled**, **vectorized**, and **reproducible** setup using modern JAX tools.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- ðŸ§  **DQN implementation in JAX** â€” fully differentiable and JIT-compiled  
- ðŸŽ® **Jumanjiâ€™s Game2048-v1** â€” a clean, RL-compatible 2048 environment  
- âš¡ **Fast & reproducible** â€” powered by JAX transformations (`jit`, `vmap`)
