# 🧩 JAX DQN on Jumanji's Game2048-v1

This repository showcases a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** implementation built with **JAX**, trained on the [`Game2048-v1`](https://github.com/instadeepai/jumanji/tree/main/jumanji/environments/logic/game_2048) environment from the **Jumanji** suite.

The project demonstrates how to train reinforcement learning agents efficiently in a **fully JIT-compiled**, **vectorized**, and **reproducible** setup using modern JAX tools.
